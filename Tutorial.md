# GMPipe Tutorial

## Overview
This is a basic tutorial for GMPipe. This can be used to preview the program and check if it meets your needs, as well as for troubleshooting. In this exercise, we will extract olfactory receptor sequences from the zebrafish (GRCz10) refseq genome from ncbi, using a set of reedfish sequences as an input (originally from: Policarpo, M., Bemis, K. E., Laurenti, P., Legendre, L., Sandoz, J. C., RÃ©taux, S., & Casane, D. (2022). Coevolution of the olfactory organ and its receptor repertoire in ray-finned fishes. BMC biology, 20(1), 195. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-022-01397-x). For this tutorial, the ORF_list.fa is provided, although it is possible to generate your own set using the GMfind_intronless_orfs.sh scripts and by downloading and unzipping the genome (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/002/035/GCF_000002035.5_GRCz10/GCF_000002035.5_GRCz10_genomic.fna.gz) and then specifying its path in the control file GMPipeline_userinput.ctl.
